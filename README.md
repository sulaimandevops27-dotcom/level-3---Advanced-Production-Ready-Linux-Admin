# Level 3 – Advanced (Production-Ready Linux Admin)

This level focuses on **advanced Linux administration tasks** for production environments.  
By completing these tasks, you will learn to **secure, scale, and maintain systems professionally**.

---

## ✅ Task Overview

### 1. Create Custom systemd Service for Your Application
Learn how to **create a custom systemd service** for your applications so they can start automatically at boot, restart on failure, and be managed easily with `systemctl`.

---

### 2. SSH Hardening for Security
Secure your Linux server by **hardening SSH**:
- Change the default port
- Disable root login
- Enable key-based authentication

This prevents unauthorized access and improves server security.

---

### 3. LVM Setup for Storage Scaling
Learn how to **use LVM (Logical Volume Manager)** to dynamically manage disk space, allowing you to expand storage without downtime.

---

### 4. Configure Firewall Rules
Use `ufw` to **allow or deny network traffic** and protect your server from unauthorized access.

---

### 5. Implement logrotate for Application Logs
Automate **log rotation, compression, and cleanup** to save disk space and keep logs organized using `logrotate`.
